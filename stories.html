<p style="color:white;">Hi my name is Marisela. I was bullied from 1st all the way to 5th grade. I'm in 11th grade now and i'm now 17, so it was a long time ago. But the scars from all those years of bullying are still there. I was a very quiet and shy kid so i guess that made me an easy target and i was treated pretty much like dirt. I should also mention my dad passed away when i was 6 and on top of that i was being bullied. When i got a little older i became depressed a lot and i never knew why. By the time i was 15 i realized i was feeling so depressed because i hadn't gotten over being bullied and i realized that i need to come to terms with that in order to move on with my life. You have to forgive because if you live with this hatred in our heart all your doing is hurting yourself. Forgiveness doesn't make what that person did to you right, forgiveness is for you so that you can move on and be happy. This process of forgiveness is something i'm still going through. I'm over the bullying for the most part but as for the people who hurt me its gonna take longer for me to forgive them for that. From my experience i've learned so much and its made me such a strong person. And i have to give a huge thanks to my family who love me unconditionally especially my mom she's everything to me. I've come a long way and my life is doing pretty good right now. If your being bullied please stay strong because life has so much in store for you and you won't want to miss out on it.</p>

<p style="color:white;">I was a nervous, olive skinned short hair girl with a temper just itching to escape. I wasn’t particularly strong, but I certainly stuck out due to my weird personality and love of cute clothing.
She was a different story… Her personality was tough and malicious, often she forced her voice to go deep and chavvy to intimidate me…it worked.
Because of me being a Buddhist, I hate turning to violence…ever. I like to remain calm and open hearted to people.
I didn’t tell teachers about it, but I was getting horrifically bullied on a daily basis by kids I didn’t even know. I guess you don’t want to feel annoying or like a tattle tale.
She stood out the most though…she was more LOUD and VOCAL. Often looking for approval for her insults by seeing how loud she can humiliate me. Everytime she commented on my race or hair, her voice would reach everyone within a good distance… Most of them would laugh and point.
It was humiliating.
Of course I didn’t fight back, I didn’t want to hurt anyone or appear to be the bully. Instead, I contacted that police and they issued a mark on her record for hate crime. Even proving the accusation with a recording off the school camera.
She stopped for a bit but recently has begun again… during a residential trip she met some popular boys and resorted to humiliating me and reverting back to her old ways to impress them.
I have been tripped up, threatened with a beating, shoved, humiliated, called racist and degrading names, had food and money thrown at my head and a group taunt me all because of her.
But I tell you all now…tell someone.
After I came off the bus crying my parents attempted to confront the mother and flat out told her that her daughter was a bully.
Only for her to deny it and insist that I was the culprit and not providing any quotes or actions that have made me the “bully”.
Tell someone…you don’t deserve to suffer. Sometimes the bully doesn’t even know what they are doing. Ignoring it won’t help.</p>
