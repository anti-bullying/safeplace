    <p class="w3-justify">Bullying has become one of the biggest epidemics in society today. It’s widespread, pervasive and the overall effects can be ruinous. It occurs everywhere:  in our communities, homes, and schools. Bullying statistics are staggering, spine-chilling and require significant consideration and instantaneous action. Types of bullying include physical, verbal, social, and cyberbullying. The way in which bullying occurs doesn’t matter: it is never okay, cool, or acceptable. We created this website as a safe place for people who are experiencing bullying, and we encourage you to contact us or use the resources listed below. </p>

<p style="color:black;">Children who are bullied are more likely to experience depression, low self-esteem, health problems, poor grades, and suicidal thoughts. At school, they lack quality friendships, dislike attending classes because of the fear that they will be targeted, and are less well accepted by peers.
In the long term, effects of bullying include reduced occupational opportunities, a desire for revenge, difficulty trusting people, interpersonal difficulties, perception of self as easy to victimize, overly sensitive, and thin-skinned, increased incidence of continued bullying and victimization, nightmares/trouble sleeping, and an increased risk of suicide, anxiety issues, and self-harm in adolescence. In fact,
a study by PsychCentral found that 16.5 percent of 16-17 year olds had self-harmed in the previous year, and 27 percent of these did so because they felt as though they “wanted to die.” In addition, those who were subjected to chronic bullying over a number of years at primary school were nearly five times more likely to self-harm six to seven years later in adolescence. </p>

<p style="color:white;">Hi my name is Marisela. I was bullied from 1st all the way to 5th grade. I'm in 11th grade now and i'm now 17, so it was a long time ago. But the scars from all those years of bullying are still there. I was a very quiet and shy kid so i guess that made me an easy target and i was treated pretty much like dirt. I should also mention my dad passed away when i was 6 and on top of that i was being bullied. When i got a little older i became depressed a lot and i never knew why. By the time i was 15 i realized i was feeling so depressed because i hadn't gotten over being bullied and i realized that i need to come to terms with that in order to move on with my life. You have to forgive because if you live with this hatred in our heart all your doing is hurting yourself. Forgiveness doesn't make what that person did to you right, forgiveness is for you so that you can move on and be happy. This process of forgiveness is something i'm still going through. I'm over the bullying for the most part but as for the people who hurt me its gonna take longer for me to forgive them for that. From my experience i've learned so much and its made me such a strong person. And i have to give a huge thanks to my family who love me unconditionally especially my mom she's everything to me. I've come a long way and my life is doing pretty good right now. If your being bullied please stay strong because life has so much in store for you and you won't want to miss out on it.</p>

<p style="color:white;">I was a nervous, olive skinned short hair girl with a temper just itching to escape. I wasn’t particularly strong, but I certainly stuck out due to my weird personality and love of cute clothing.
She was a different story… Her personality was tough and malicious, often she forced her voice to go deep and chavvy to intimidate me…it worked.
Because of me being a Buddhist, I hate turning to violence…ever. I like to remain calm and open hearted to people.
I didn’t tell teachers about it, but I was getting horrifically bullied on a daily basis by kids I didn’t even know. I guess you don’t want to feel annoying or like a tattle tale.
She stood out the most though…she was more LOUD and VOCAL. Often looking for approval for her insults by seeing how loud she can humiliate me. Everytime she commented on my race or hair, her voice would reach everyone within a good distance… Most of them would laugh and point.
It was humiliating.
Of course I didn’t fight back, I didn’t want to hurt anyone or appear to be the bully. Instead, I contacted that police and they issued a mark on her record for hate crime. Even proving the accusation with a recording off the school camera.
She stopped for a bit but recently has begun again… during a residential trip she met some popular boys and resorted to humiliating me and reverting back to her old ways to impress them.
I have been tripped up, threatened with a beating, shoved, humiliated, called racist and degrading names, had food and money thrown at my head and a group taunt me all because of her.
But I tell you all now…tell someone.
After I came off the bus crying my parents attempted to confront the mother and flat out told her that her daughter was a bully.
Only for her to deny it and insist that I was the culprit and not providing any quotes or actions that have made me the “bully”.
Tell someone…you don’t deserve to suffer. Sometimes the bully doesn’t even know what they are doing. Ignoring it won’t help.</p>

<p style="color:white;"> A group of kids thought it would be funny if they played a prank on me during the homecoming dance. Instead of electing a well-know popular girl
  to be homecoming queen they elected me. When I heard the announcement I was excited because I thought people liked me but I was wrong. The boy that was elected to be homecoming
  king pulled out. Girls started teasing me on Facebook and that's when I figured out the trick.I was devistated and I decided I wasn't going to show up. But then the members of the
  West Branch community found out waht had happend. A resident of the town Jamie Cline, 35, started a Facebook page in order to support me. The page got a lot of likes and it ended up
  going viral. Jamie opened up a bank account so I could get donations in order to attend the dance but it turned out that I didn't need it. Local business decided to donate everything
  from my hairstyling to the makeup and clothes, even pictures at the dance. A bunch of the town residents are going to the homecoming game to support me when I come out at haltime, they
  are going to be wearing my favorite color orange.</p>

  <p style="color:white;"> Thirteen year old Nadin Khoury was beaten by a group of older students who hung him to a fence and recorded the beating. Nadin stood up to his attackers and identified
    them to the police. The bullies were suspended for a brief period of time but then returned to Nadin's school. Thirty miles away at the Head of Dchool at Wyncote Academy offered Nadin a full ride
    the attend the private school so he could grow and learn in a safe enviroment.Nadin acceptedt the offer and is now attending Wyncote Academy.</p>

  <p>We are part of the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Progam at Prudential Financial. Throughout these seven weeks we've learned several different introdutory courses that deal with computer science and coding. As a group, we decided to focus our final project on anti-bullying. Bullying is now an epidemic as occurs so often in a day. The main purpose of our website is to further educate people about bullying and essentially provide resources on how to prevent it from occuring in the future.</p>
