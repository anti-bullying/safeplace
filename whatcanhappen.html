<p style="color:white;">Children who are bullied are more likely to experience depression, low self-esteem, health problems, poor grades, and suicidal thoughts. At school, they lack quality friendships, dislike attending classes because of the fear that they will be targeted, and are less well accepted by peers.
In the long term, effects of bullying include reduced occupational opportunities, a desire for revenge, difficulty trusting people, interpersonal difficulties, perception of self as easy to victimize, overly sensitive, and thin-skinned, increased incidence of continued bullying and victimization, nightmares/trouble sleeping, and an increased risk of suicide, anxiety issues, and self-harm in adolescence. In fact,
a study by PsychCentral found that 16.5 percent of 16-17 year olds had self-harmed in the previous year, and 27 percent of these did so because they felt as though they “wanted to die.” In addition, those who were subjected to chronic bullying over a number of years at primary school were nearly five times more likely to self-harm six to seven years later in adolescence. </p>
